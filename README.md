# About QBoards

QBoard is a project to create a collection of small tools that facilitate Electronic 
Engineering, using readily available parts. For PCBs we aim to create well designed 
boards that can be purchased by low cost vendors such as <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com">
Seeed Studio</a>, <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSHPark</a> or <a href="https://dirtypcbs.com">DirtyPCBs</a>.
